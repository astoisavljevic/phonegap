1. A BIT of history

    Delivering content to mobile users always was/is a challenge for
application architects.
Some of the things that you have to think about are:
    - how to efficently update content
    - usage of familiar technologies, etc.

Let we do a small time travel in past. Our destination: moment when
smart-phones hit the market.
At that moment applications could be grouped in two main categories:
    - pure web-based applications - all of their content was coming
from a server, and as opposite to this approach
    - pure mobile applications, where all of their content resides
on a mobile device.

Each of these approaches has it's own advantages and disadvantages.

Mobile applications
-------------------

Pros:
    - Fast (this comes from the fact that all of the needed resources
are already on the device)
    - Easy for user to find (go to market, download and have it on phone
in applications)

Cons:
    - Hard to update - each fix or update is subject of review hence
time to "hit" end user can be long

Pure web applications
---------------------

Pros:
    - Easy to update - all of the content is changed on server thus
immediately available to end user to use

Cons:
    - Slow - network is crucial resource here (speed, quality, coverage, ...)
    - Hard to find - user has to remember URL, dealing with bookmarks, etc.

Therefore combination of these two "worlds" seems logical.

2. Hybrid Mobile Application Development

    Previously we saw best features of mobile and web-based applications.
We could define "hybrid" applications as application that can be partitioned
so that part runs on mobile device and part is delivered by server.

<image that shows hybrid application combine resources both from device and web>

What makes hybrid application successful?

- User must not be affected with transition between resources from device and
web.
- User interface should look like a mobile app, both mobile and web-based sides.


Let's concentrate now on this part of "hybrid" definition:
"application that can be partitioned so that part runs on mobile device and part is delivered by server."
Since you are here and not on presentation of "high performance PHP" I will assume that
you have some experience on mobile development. So if you are not at level of "Hello World"
application development, you must use at least some colaboration between your code and
some 3rd party service. Nowadays, this can be done in various ways: SOAP, XML, JSON, ...

Currently I'm working on some project that we provide REST API with endpoints that consumes/produces
JSON. And also we have coleagues in Holland, iOS developers and Android developers.
As a result we have web application, and one thin client application for iOS and one for Android.

Ok, now here comes the "punch line". One day when we sail in "shallow waters of project maintanance",
product owners decide to extend business and to support Windows Phone. And suddenly we are in problem.
First you need to find programmer that can acomplish the job. Even he is the best programmer in the
world, you will have to support him for some time, explaining each endpoint, explain different
combination of request parameters, etc. It will cost you, beside nerves which you will lose anyway,
time. Time.equals(Money) = TRUE.
And suddenly management decides to go with version for BlackBerry :)

Now you see the point. Mobile devices segmentation is "nightmare" for the programmers.

Can we have single source code base?

3. Why not using something that we already know?
