1. A BIT of history

    Delivering content to mobile users always was/is a challenge for
application architects.
Some of the things that you have to think about are:
    - how to efficently update content
    - usage of familiar technologies, etc.

Let we do a small time travel in past. Our destination: moment when
smart-phones hit the market.
At that moment applications could be grouped in two main categories:
    - pure web-based applications - all of their content was coming
from a server, and as opposite to this approach
    - pure mobile applications, where all of their content resides
on a mobile device.

Each of these approaches has it's own advantages and disadvantages.

Mobile applications
-------------------

Pros:
    - Fast (this comes from the fact that all of the needed resources
are already on the device)
    - Easy for user to find (go to market, download and have it on phone
in applications)

Cons:
    - Hard to update - each fix or update is subject of review hence
time to "hit" end user can be long

Pure web applications
---------------------

Pros:
    - Easy to update - all of the content is changed on server thus
immediately available to end user to use

Cons:
    - Slow - network is crucial resource here (speed, quality, coverage, ...)
    - Hard to find - user has to remember URL, dealing with bookmarks, etc.

Therefore combination of these two "worlds" seems logical.
